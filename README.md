# 🚨 Major Update: Moving to Godot 4 🚨

Rustfall is officially moving to **[Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/)** with **GDScript**.  
I’ve decided to switch engines because **Flutter + Flame aren’t built for large-scale open-world or 3D voxel-style games**.  

### Why Godot?  
- ⚡ **Performance:** Godot is optimized for both 2D & 3D game development.  
- 🎮 **Scalability:** Supports the kind of **semi-open world mechanics** Rustfall needs.  
- 🧩 **Flexibility:** Powerful tools for procedural generation, voxel-style environments, and complex gameplay systems.  
- 💙 **Community & Ecosystem:** A huge, supportive developer base with tons of learning resources.  

> 🎓 *I’m currently learning Godot & GDScript from scratch — this means progress may be slower at first, but the long-term vision for Rustfall will be far stronger.*  

⚠️ **Note:** This repository will eventually be replaced by a new one dedicated to the Godot version of Rustfall. Stay tuned for updates.

## 🎮 About Rustfall

**Rustfall** is my passion project — a game born from my vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Players will shape their own destiny, exploring a semi-open world filled with danger, mystery, and opportunity.  

**Planned Key Features:**  

- 🛡 **Player-driven factions:** Control your own fate and make impactful choices.  
- 🎁 **Procedurally generated loot:** Every expedition yields unique rewards.  
- 🏕 **Camp building & management:** Construct and expand your camps, recruit NPCs, and grow your community.  
- 📜 **Quest-driven gameplay:** Engage in immersive storylines and challenges that shape the world around you.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Rustfall is in its *early, PLANNING!*. I’m prioritizing learning and prototyping — quality and long-term vision come before speed.
