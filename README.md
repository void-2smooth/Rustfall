## 🎮 About Rustfall

**Rustfall** is my passion project — a game born from my vision of a post-apocalyptic world. Players will shape their own destiny, exploring a semi-open world filled with danger, mystery, and opportunity.  

**Key features include:**  

- 🛡 **Player-driven factions:** Control your own faith and make impactful choices.  
- 🎁 **Procedurally generated loot:** Every expedition yields unique rewards.  
- 🏕 **Camp building & management:** Construct and expand your camps, recruit NPCs, and grow your community.  
- 📜 **Quest-driven gameplay:** Engage in immersive storylines and challenges that shape the world around you.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Rustfall is in its early, *bearbones stage of development*. I’m taking my time to ensure quality and avoid burnout. Patience will be key as the game evolves.
